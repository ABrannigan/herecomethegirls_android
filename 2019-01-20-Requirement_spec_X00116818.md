1. * *Introduction

This section of the document provides an overview of what is included in the following sections. Also the purpose and scope are outlined along with an overview of the system. The detailed system proposal was given to 12 potential users of the system who were subsequently interviewed with the questions outlined in [(Section1.4)](#heading=h.3znysh7). The answers to these were analysed and necessary changes were made to use case and class diagrams.

    1. Purpose

The purpose of this requirements document is to provide a description of the user requirements for "here come the girls" android location application and describe the purpose of the system. It will define system constraints, interface interactions, user characteristics and dependencies. This document is intended primarily for the developer as a reference in the design of the system.  

    2. Scope

"Here Come The Girls" is an android based real time location app for bachelorette parties. The app will allow users to locate one another through the use of the mobile devices built in GPS, Google maps and PubNub real-time technology.

Users can send and receive messages to all members of the group using PubNub API. The user may also get direction to the place they are staying by using the GPS navigation.

The application will be available for free on android store for download.

    3. Interview Questions

* Can you see yourself using this App?

* Can you think of any other use for this App other than the intended use?

* What might keep you from using this App?

* Would you be willing to pay for this App?

* Do you think you can trust this App?

* Have you used any other App similar to this if yes what?

* What types of colour scheme do you imagine an App like this should have?

* Would you feel confident using an app that uses Google Maps?

* Was there anything missing that you would expect from an App like this?

* What feature would you think would improve this App?

    4. Findings

Analysis of the interview response found that a majority of participants agreed that Chat functionality would be something that they would expect from an app like this. It was determined that a chat feature would make potential users more likely to download the app therefore this feature will be added with the displacement of the SOS message function as the chat will negate the need for it. These findings are reflected in the use case diagram iterations in [(Section3.2)](#heading=h.1ksv4uv) and the class diagrams in [(Section 3.3)](#heading=h.1ci93xb).

    5. Overview of the system

The mobile application will need to communicate with both PubNub which in turn communicates with Google Maps and the Local GPS device in order to provide location information. Each device can send and receive location information allowing users to find one another on the map and get direction as needed. This information will be displayed to the user in a map view.

The device will communicate with PubNub in order to post and read messages that will be available to all devices within the group. This functionality will be displayed in a message board view on the device.

Since this application is not data-centric there is no need to store much data so the need for a data base is circumvented as and data that needs to be stored can be done so using PubNub and locally. 

2. User Requirements 

    6. User Characteristics	

The target users for this application will be women with an average age of 33 years with professional occupations as according to (CentralStatisticsOffice, 2017) the average age of brides in Ireland as of 2015 is 33.3 and the highest number of marriages are of people of a professional background although not all users will fall within these parameters this target audience will give the largest group to base the application design. 

    7. Constraints

The application is constrained by the device internet connection as without sufficient connection the app will not be able to send or receive messages furthermore without internet connection the app will be unable to view location data.

Another Constraint of the app is the reliance on the built in GPS signal low signal can have a significant effect on location accuracy.

The app runs on a mobile device which provides its own set of constraints to be considered such as smaller screen size, one screen appears at a time, shorter battery life, slower processor and less memory. 

    8. Assumptions and Dependencies

The main assumption of this application is that the app will be running on a device with sufficient hardware resources to run the app. Also it is assumed the device is running a minimum android SDK version 21. If the assumption made are not the case the app may run slow or may not run at all.
